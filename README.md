An AI-powered web scraper using Crawl4AI automates lead generation by extracting local business details like names, addresses, and phone numbers from YellowPages.

The scraper integrates LLMs such as GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek to clean, format, and enhance data.

Results are exported to CSV files for easy use in outreach or analysis tasks.

It is customizable to suit various websites and data types by modifying AI instructions and CSS selectors.

Use cases include lead generation, market research, competitor analysis, and data enrichment.

The project requires Python 3.11+ and API keys for LLM providers to function.

Dependencies are listed in a requirements.txt file, and a virtual environment can be set up for package management.

API credentials must be specified in a .env file to enable LLM functionality.

Execute the scraper using python main.py to crawl, extract data, and save it as businesses_data.csv.

Configuration options in config.py include model selection, base URL, maximum pages, and more.
